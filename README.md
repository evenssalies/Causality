# Causality _(in progress ...)_[^1]

## What's in here? _(to be completed soon)_

__Causes and effects.__ You'll find material on causal inference for problems where one's aim is to measure the effects of some more or less controlled _**X**_ on some _Y_. [...]

__Motivation.__ My main motivation behind this Git is twofold:

1. Share insights from inventors in econometrics and data science.
2. Emphasize differences between those disciplines.

Regarding point 2, e.g., the method of __Least Squares__ used in _Econometrics_ to estimate a model parameters is used for __training__ in _Machine Learning_.  

__Forgotten Econometrics in AI.__ AI, more particularly ML, omits important insights from Econometrics. Though seminal, the book by GÃ©ron, A. (2022) _Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_, O'Reilly, applies model-based learning to economic data without any reference to the underlying economic problem. His discussion on overfitting is interesting but the model is clearly misspecified; it lacks __economic__ explanatory variables.  

__Eonometric methods that data scientists should know about.__ In puting this question we take an opposite perspective to a 2019's paper by Athey and Imbens: _Machine learning methods that economists should know about_,  [Lien](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053433 "Athey, S., Imbens, G. (2019)").
